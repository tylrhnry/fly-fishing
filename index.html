                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    Fly fishing is using artificial bait to catch fish. 
                    Often times, fly fishers use hand-tied flies made of
                    fur, feathers, and synthetic materials to imitate the 
                    look of natural bugs and fish. For beginners, it is 
                    easiest to purchase these online or in stores. Although, 
                    over time, it may become more cost effective to learn 
                    to tie them yourself. 
                    <br>
                    There are three main categories of flies. Dry flies, 
                    nymphs, and streamers. Dry flies are the most well-
                    known and are flies that are meant to float on the surface 
                    of the water. They represent adult bugs. Nymphs are meant 
                    to sink and represent bugs in the beginning stages of the 
                    life cycle that still live underwater. And streamers are 
                    meant to appear like small fish. 
                    <br>
                    Although nymphs and streamers can be very effective, it 
                    is simplest to start with dry flies.

                    <h3>Why do it?</h3>
                    Fly fishing is much more involed that bait fishing. A 
                    comparison I often make is that it is like the difference 
                    in driving a manual versus an automatic car. You have a lot 
                    more control over the situation and have a lot more 
                    flexibility, but it is also more difficult.

                    </figure>
                    The challenge is part of the enjoyment for many people. 
                    Fly fishing is much more of a sport as compared to throwing
                    a worm or power bait into a lake and waiting for a fish to 
                    come by and take the bait.
                    <br>
                    And a primary reason for me is that it can be much more 
                    successful. When fishing in high mountain lakes and rivers, 
                    fish are usually native. This means they are very accustomed 
                    to eating bugs and fish and are generally not interested in 
                    power bait. I have been on a handful of campouts with friends 
                    where I was the only one able to catch fish because I was the 
                    only one fly fishing.

                  <h3>Fly rod</h3>
                  Naturally, if you want to fly fish, you'll need a fly rod. 
                  These can be bought from a variety of places and it doesn't 
                  need to be anything special. I would recommend finding one 
                  that can be split into several parts for easier storage and 
                  transportation. 
                  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Water-Fishing-Complete-Starter/dp/B001IAHX6A/" target="_blank">This</a> 
                  is a fine starter rod.
                  <br><br>
                  If you buy a pre-setup kit, you won't have to deal with 
                  stringing your own reel. If you decide to buy parts individually 
                  though, you should know the basics.
                  <br>
                  The main difference with casting a fly rod is the bait is often 
                  extemely light. When you cast a normal rod, the weight carries 
                  the line. This isn't the case here. That's why fly rods have the 
                  distinctive, thick line. The line itself is the weight you cast. 
                  On the end of the floating line, you'll have two different types 
                  of monofilament. A tapered leader and tippet. The tapered leader 
                  is meant to provide a smooth diameter transition between the 
                  thick floating line and the tippet. This also aids in a smooth 
                  of energy to the fly. The tippet is the thinnest part of the 
                  line and helps to not be visible to the fish or affect the motion 
                  of the fly. And that's it. It's more complicated than what you 
                  may be used to, but there are tutorials helping you with all the 
                  knots you'll need (one will be in the examples tab).

                    <h3>Flies</h3>
                    What would fly fishing be without the flies? 
                    Like I stated on the home page, dry flies are best for beginners. 
                    You can buy flies from stores or make your own, although buying 
                    them online is usually cheaper. I get my flies from 
                    <a href="https://www.flydealflies.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These are some flies that I have had great success with trout fishing.

                    <br>
                    In fly fishing, there is a a phrase called, "matching the hatch". 
                    This means you should be fishing with a fly that looks like the 
                    natural bugs that are alive at that time. This will depend on the 
                    time of year and where you are. This is why an assortment of flies 
                    is nice to have.
